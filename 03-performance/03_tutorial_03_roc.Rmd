## ROC and confusion matrix

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Get familiar with confusion matrices and ROC
- Know how to evaluate the performance of a (multiclass) classifier

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

```{r ROC-quiz, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are false?",
    answer("If the proportion of positive to negative instances changes, the ROC curve will not     change."),
    answer("Evaluating a binary classifier is only possible using the misclassification error.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Several evaluation metrics can be derived from a confusion matrix."),
    answer("ROC curves are sensitive to class distribution.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The area under the ROC curve is AUC and AUC $\\in (0, 1]$.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In a ROC curve, the best classifier lies on the top-right corner.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("AUC = 0 means that all negatives are ranked higher than all positives.")
  )
```
