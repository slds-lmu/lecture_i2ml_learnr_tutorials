## Performance Estimation

**Study Goals**

- Learn why and what performance estimation is
- Get familiar with the training error and the test error

**Preparation**

Watch the following video (sorry, rather low volume...):

**Exercises**

```{r performance-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("We can reduce the model's variance on the cost of its bias and vice versa by controlling the model complexity.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In logistic regression we minimize the binomial loss and in kNN there is no explicit loss minimization.",correct = TRUE),
     answer("Goodness-of-fit measures like $R^2$, likelihood, AIC, BIC, deviance are all based on the test error"),
    answer("The training error is usually a very unreliable and overly optimistic estimator of future performance.", correct = TRUE)
)
```
