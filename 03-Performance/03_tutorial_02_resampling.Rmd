#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r resampling-quiz, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("The method of resampling is a nonparametric method of statistical inference.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Subsampling is basically a repeated holdout and is also very similar to
           bootstrapping, so subsampling is done with replacement."),
    answer("Estimating the expected generalization error is a goal of resampling.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In Resampling, the data set is split repeatedly into training and tests
          sets.", correct = TRUE)

  )
