## Components of a learner

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Be able do differentiate between regression and classification tasks

*Practical (P)*

- Get to know how to create tasks in `mlr`

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following videos:

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r components-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Tasks",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("Supervised learning tasks are prediction problems.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Unsupervised learning tries to discover structure and patterns in
           the training data.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Every unsupervised task is internally treated as supervised task."),
    answer("Unsupervised learning is learning without a target variable.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Classification is a supervised learning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Regression is a supervised learning task.",
           correct = TRUE),
    answer("Clustering is a supervised learning task.")
  )
