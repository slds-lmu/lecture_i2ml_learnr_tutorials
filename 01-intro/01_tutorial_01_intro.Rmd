## Introduction

### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn what the main components of a machine learning model are
- Get familiar with the three components of an inducer

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r basics-quiz, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer("A model $f$  is a mapping from the feature space $\\mathcal{X}$ to the target space $\\mathcal{Y}$.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The goal of an ML algorithm is to yield a model that reproduces the already seen data as accurately as possible."),
    answer("ML algorithms try to predict the target variable as accurately as possible based on the values of the features.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("For a given hypothesis class $H$, different optimization procedures can be used to find the best model $f \\in H$.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Providing two different training data sets to a learner will result in the same optimal model $f$."),
    answer("The *representation* of a learner defines its hypothesis class $H$.", correct = TRUE)
  )
```
