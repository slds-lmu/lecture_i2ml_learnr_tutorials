### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz

```{r tree-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements about CART are true?",
    answer("Monotone transformations of several features will change structure of the tree."),
    answer("The CART-Algorithm could just continue until there is a single observation in each node.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Prediction function isn't smooth because a step function is fftted.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Really not the best predictor.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Getting into trouble with outliers in features."),
    answer("Missing values can be handled.",correct = TRUE),
    answer("Decisions on the upper level influence decisions
on lower levels.",correct = TRUE),
 answer("To fit a linear function $y \approx a + b*x$ with a regression tree well, you only need a very simple tree")
)
```
