## Introduction to Classification

### Study Goals

- Learn how classification works.
- Know the differences of generative approach and discriminant approach

### Preparation

Watch the following video (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### Quiz

```{r basics-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("Classification is part of supervised learning.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The decision boundary is independent of the used model."),
  answer("Binary classification uses two discriminant functions."),
  answer("Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries."),
  answer("The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same."),
  answer("The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach."),
  answer("For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.", correct = TRUE)
)
```

```{r basics-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
# quiz(caption = "Basic Terminology",
  question("Which statements are true?",
    answer(" The discriminant approach assumes a data generating process, in which the x have different distributions, depending on the class. The generative approach attempts to minimize a loss function."),
    answer("Linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach, while Quadratic discriminant analysis is not."),
    answer("The discriminant approach tries to model the discriminant score function directly.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Logistic regression is a discriminant approach", correct = TRUE)
  )
```
