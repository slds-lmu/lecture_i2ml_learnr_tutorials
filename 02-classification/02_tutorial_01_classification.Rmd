## Introduction to Classification


### Study Goals

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn what a classifier is
- Difference between linear and non-linear classifiers
- Generative vs. discriminative approach

### Preparation

1.  *(T)* Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

### Exercises

#### *(T)* Quiz


```{r classi-quiz1, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are true?",
  answer("Classification is part of supervised learning.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The decision boundary is independent of the used model."),
  answer("Binary classification uses two discriminant functions."),
  answer("Linear classifiers can just learn linear decision boundaries."),
  answer("For the discriminant approach we must have a loss function for minimization.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("The generative and discriminant approach are basically the same."),
  answer("The generative approach is a probabilistic approach.", correct = TRUE)
  
)
```

```{r classi-quiz2, echo=FALSE}
  question("Which statements are false?",
    answer("The discriminant approach assumes a data generating process, in which the data have different distributions, depending on the class. The generative approach attempts to minimize a loss function.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Linear discriminant analysis is a discriminant approach, while Quadratic discriminant analysis is not.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The discriminant approach tries to model the discriminant score function directly."),
    answer("Logistic regression is a discriminant approach")
  )
```
