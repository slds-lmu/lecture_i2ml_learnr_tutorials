## Approaches to Classification

**Study Goals**

*Theoretical (T)*

- Learn how generative model works
- Get familiar with LDA, QDA and naive Bayes classifier

*Practical (P)*
- Get to know how to fit a generative model in `mlr`

**Preparation**

1.  Watch the following video  (sorry, rather low volume...):

**Exercises**

```{r knn-quiz, echo=FALSE}
question("Which statements are false?",
  answer("In the LDA, each class density is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian with unequal covariance.", correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the QDA, each class density is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian with equal covariance", correct = TRUE),
  answer("In the Naive Bayes classifier, covariance matrices can differ over both classes but have to be diagonal.")
)
```
